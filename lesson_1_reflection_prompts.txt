How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    if I try to find the difference by eyes, it is possible that I can not find all
    of them. That's is the benefit to use a diff command and let computer to the work 
    for you.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Keep tracking on all my changes manually will be hugh pain for me to maintence the project 
    in the long term. But if there is not a easy way to mange that, it will be waste time, too.
    I believe git will be a better solution.

    作为一个网页开发者，在网页开发的过程中必然会出现很多的修改和变更，因此能够及时保存变更是非常重要的。无论是自动还是手动
    保存，都能够在需要的时候提供回溯的可能，这是非常重要的。

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Git Pros: You will know which version you saved, and easy to get the vrsion version at any time.
    	Cons: Learning to use git and use it well need time, the learning curve of git is sharp, 
    	instead, press a save button is much easier for most people.

    	Git commits 的决定是开发者基于开发逻辑的考虑提出的，每个 commit 都有其自己的目的，而Google Doc 的自动保存是由软件决定的，这就意味着每个保存历史未必那么有意义。

    Google doc Pros&Cons: you don't need to remember to save, that means maybe you will not lost any changes, 
    but the same time if you want to go back to the previous version will be impossible. 


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I guess maybe because the mechanism they use are different.Git 的 repository 实际上是相关联的若干个文件，每次 Commit 都会提交这若干个文件的变更。变更可以通过 diff'查看。而 googledoc 每次只保存一个文件的变更，如果要保存多个文件的变更需要在不同文件上重复相同的操作。

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log and git diff ID1 ID2

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can go back any previous version by using git. That's why I can try  something bold even crazy.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Maybe set a git repository first. 
    Use git to mange every project of mine from now on.
