when would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when you need to work with other people, or want to share your project to the rest of the world.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   Make the logical decision as commits instead ofsave automaticlly. If save automaticlly, that means you might update some 
   unfinshed code even errors, make the people who work with you confused.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork are a clone of other person's project on github, you can fork them and make your revision on your own account. THe revision does not affect the original projected you forked. Clone means copy someone's project from remote to local, you can do revise on your own computer. Branch is to try some new things on your local project, it will not involve anything online.
